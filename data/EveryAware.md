## Description
The EveryAware platform provides an extendable data concept that could be used to enhance the possibilities of sharing and processing data feeds. The platform is running on a centralized server. This platform was the one providing the finer-granularity of data visibility with four different levels (details, statistics, anonymous, none). A REST API has been integrated to access the data (extendable data models).
