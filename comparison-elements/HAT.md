## Description
The Hub-of-All-Things (H.A.T.) platform has as primary objective the creation of multi-sided market platform to generate new economic and business opportunities using IoT data generated by a __smart home__. An important feature of the H.A.T. is that the data belongs to the individual. It enables the end-users to get control of their data, and thus maintaining their expectations about privacy and other issues. In particular, the H.A.T architecture defines different kind of applications (in-apps and out-apps). The “in-apps” (owned by either residents, landlords or building managers) have their content enriched by local data available on the private H.A.T, while “out-apps” may be used by external platforms.
