## Description
(“if this then that”) is a SaaS offering, allowing a rapid composition of services called “recipes” by applying simple if-then rules to external service building blocks, such as emails, Facebook events, or Belkin’s WeMo switch, that either play the role of a trigger (if) or an action (then, do). Though the service is free to use, the APIs to the service are not open at the time of writing. The recipes can be personal or shared at the discrepancy of the user; otherwise, the service building blocks rather than IFTTT deal with the user generated data.
