## Description
The TerraSwarm project envision the development of a new kind of operating system, the SwarmOS, to natively support the heterogeneous nature of the devices and solutions existing in the IoT and enable the infrastructure with the ability to aggregate information from a variety of data sources. The architecture relies heavily on the power of cloud computing. The operating system will be also open-source to improve its reliability and efficiency, while maximizing the potential of innovative development of “swarm-apps” build upon the system.
