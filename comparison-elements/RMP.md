## Description

The Multi-purpose Binding and Provisioning Platform (MBP), formerly known as Resource Management Platform (RMP), is a prototypical implementation for the automated sensor registration, binding and provisioning of sensor data. It enables: 
(i) description of sensors, actuators and devices as well as their attributes, 
(ii) the registration of sensors and actuators of a physical device, 
(iii) the provisioning of sensor data using different data access paradigms (i.e., pull or through subscriptions), and 
(iv) dynamic sensor and actuator binding based on application requirements.
