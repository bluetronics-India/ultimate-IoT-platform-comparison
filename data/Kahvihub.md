## Description
The Kahvihub platform is open-source and designed to be extremely extendable, as all components in the Kahvihub are delivered by third-parties, in the form of plugins or applications. These components are preferably scripted, to ensure a high re-usability of the platformâ€™s operations on a different platform implementation (the platform is expected to be deployed on various and heterogeneous hardware). The Kahvihub prototype is aiming to enable edge analytics by creating local networks of IoT devices that can collaboratively and autonomously analyze the data that they produce.
