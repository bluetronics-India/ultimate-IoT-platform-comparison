## Description
Xively (formerly Pachube) is a proprietary cloud-based platform (PaaS). Ownership of the data remains to the user, but the data is stored on the Xively server. Xively provides open-source APIs (in various programming languages) mostly with the BSD 3-clause license. Xively provides an extensive RESTful API including a search tool in order to retrieve feeds (flow of data) depending on selected characteristics (location radius, name, type of data stored, etc.)
