## Description
Node-RED is an open-source Node.js tool that aims to simplify the connection between IoT devices and web services. It incorporates the concept of flow for IoT devices and data that allows complex interactions between objects and services. The flow can be published on the Node-RED website for sharing. Node-RED is a creation of IBM Emerging Technology. Some cloud-based services, such as FRED,9 provide front-end for Node-RED and others [28] integrate Node-RED to their own platform (e.g., WotKit) for added values.
