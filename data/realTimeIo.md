## Description
IoBridge realTime.io provides a proprietary cloud-based platform (PaaS) to connect devices to the Internet and build applications upon the data. As realTime.io uses a proprietary transport protocol for data, ioDP, the physical devices need to be connected to the realTime.io cloud service via a proprietary gateway. Once these gateways are connected to the service, public API (requiring realTime.io keys) enables the connection to the device to pull or push data to the devices.
