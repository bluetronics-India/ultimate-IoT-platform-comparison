## Description
Open.Sen.se is closed-source PaaS/SaaS. A tool called Funnel can be used to aggregate data, but only on data feeds that are within our dashboard. It is possible to get the data from different source and mash it up. The platform uses the JSON data format and REST API for web services development. The privacy of data visualization is either public or private, data is always private (needs private keys at all times to use the API).
