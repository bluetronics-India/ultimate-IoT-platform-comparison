## Description
EvryThng is a proprietary centralized platform (SaaS) that provides a persistent presence on the Web of identifiable objects (RFID, NFC, connected objects, etc.). It allows via RESTful API to store and retrieve metadata as well as real-time data for these objects. The API allows fine-access grained control to easy sharing of products information. No search tools are available to find data feeds. Billing is done on-demand. The EvryThng platform includes standard protocols MQTT and CoAP.
