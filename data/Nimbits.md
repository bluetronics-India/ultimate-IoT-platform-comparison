## Description
Similarly to ARM mbed, the Nimbits server has been made cloud architecture compatible, hence it scales from a single private server to a cloud architecture. Nimbits includes three levels of privacy for the data: (i) private, (ii) protected (read-only is public) and (iii) public. Control over the data and its ownership is to the user. The data is transmitted via XMPP messaging protocol. Web services access the data with HTML POST request and JSON data format. The platform is open source licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
