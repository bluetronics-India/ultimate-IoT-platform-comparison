## Description
Bugâ€™s Swarm cloud-based platform (PaaS) is not open-source but provides an open-source client and some tools (unknown license). It creates swarm of resources to consume data, produce data or both among actors connected to the swarm. There is limited information on how the swarm data is stored, and who had its ownership. A RESTful API and JSON data format are usable to communicate with the devices. The platforms also provide GUI tools, such an interactive dashboard with data visualization capabilities.
